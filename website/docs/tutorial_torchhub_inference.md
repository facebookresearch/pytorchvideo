title: Running a pre-trained PyTorchVideo classification model using Torch Hub
---

# Introduction

PyTorchVideo provides several pretrained models through [Torch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/). In this tutorial we will show how to load a pre trained video classification model in PyTorchVideo and run it on a test video. The PyTorchVideo Torch Hub models were trained on the Kinetics 400 [1] dataset.  Available models are described in [model zoo documentation](https://pytorchvideo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_zoo.html).

# Imports

```python
import torch
import json
from torchvision.transforms import Compose, Lambda
from torchvision.transforms._transforms_video import (
    CenterCropVideo,
    NormalizeVideo,
)
from pytorchvideo.data.encoded_video import EncodedVideo
from pytorchvideo.transforms import (
    ApplyTransformToKey,
    ShortSideScale,
    UniformTemporalSubsample,
    UniformCropVideo
)
from typing import Dict
```

# Load Model

Let's select the `slowfast_r50` model which was trained on the Kinetics 400 dataset.

```python
# Device on which to run the model
# Set to cuda to load on GPU
device = "cpu"

# Pick a pretrained model and load the pretrained weights
model_name = "slowfast_r50"
model = torch.hub.load("facebookresearch/pytorchvideo", model=model_name, pretrained=True)

# Set to eval mode and move to desired device
model = model.to(device)
model = model.eval()
```

# Setup Labels

Next let's download the id-to-label mapping for the Kinetics 400 dataset on which the torch hub models were trained. This will be used to get the category label names from the predicted class ids.

```python
!wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/pyslowfast/dataset/class_names/kinetics_classnames.json
```

```python
with open("kinetics_classnames.json", "r") as f:
    kinetics_classnames = json.load(f)

# Create an id to label name mapping
kinetics_id_to_classname = {}
for k, v in kinetics_classnames.items():
    kinetics_id_to_classname[v] = str(k).replace('"', "")
```

# Input Transform

Before passing the video into the model we need to apply some input transforms and sample a clip of the correct duration.

NOTE: The input transforms are specific to the model. If you choose a different model than the example in this tutorial, please refer to the code provided in the Torch Hub documentation and copy over the relevant transforms:

    - [SlowFast](https://pytorch.org/hub/facebookresearch_pytorchvideo_slowfast/)
    - [X3D](https://pytorch.org/hub/facebookresearch_pytorchvideo_x3d/)
    - [Slow](https://pytorch.org/hub/facebookresearch_pytorchvideo_resnet/)

```python
####################
# SlowFast transform
####################

side_size = 256
mean = [0.45, 0.45, 0.45]
std = [0.225, 0.225, 0.225]
crop_size = 256
num_frames = 32
sampling_rate = 2
frames_per_second = 30
alpha = 4

class PackPathway(torch.nn.Module):
    """
    Transform for converting video frames as a list of tensors.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def forward(self, frames: torch.Tensor):
        fast_pathway = frames
        # Perform temporal sampling from the fast pathway.
        slow_pathway = torch.index_select(
            frames,
            1,
            torch.linspace(
                0, frames.shape[1] - 1, frames.shape[1] // alpha
            ).long(),
        )
        frame_list = [slow_pathway, fast_pathway]
        return frame_list

transform =  ApplyTransformToKey(
    key="video",
    transform=Compose(
        [
            UniformTemporalSubsample(num_frames),
            Lambda(lambda x: x/255.0),
            NormalizeVideo(mean, std),
            ShortSideScale(
                size=side_size
            ),
            CenterCropVideo(crop_size),
            PackPathway()
        ]
    ),
)

# The duration of the input clip is also specific to the model.
clip_duration = (num_frames * sampling_rate)/frames_per_second
```

# Load an example video
We can now test the model with an example video from the Kinetics validation set such as this [archery video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3and4vWkW4s).

We will load the video and apply the input transform.


```python
# Download the example video file
!wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/pytorchvideo/projects/archery.mp4
```

```python
# Load the example video
video_path = "archery.mp4"

# Select the duration of the clip to load by specifying the start and end duration
# The start_sec should correspond to where the action occurs in the video
start_sec = 0
end_sec = start_sec + clip_duration

# Initialize an EncodedVideo helper class
video = EncodedVideo.from_path(video_path)

# Load the desired clip
video_data = video.get_clip(start_sec=start_sec, end_sec=end_sec)

# Apply a transform to normalize the video input
video_data = transform(video_data)

# Move the inputs to the desired device
inputs = video_data["video"]
inputs = [i.to(device)[None, ...] for i in inputs]
```

### Get model predictions

Now we are ready to pass the input into the model and classify the action.

```python
# Pass the input clip through the model
preds = model(inputs)
```

Let's look at the top 5 best predictions:

```python
# Get the predicted classes
post_act = torch.nn.Softmax(dim=1)
preds = post_act(preds)
pred_classes = preds.topk(k=5).indices

# Map the predicted classes to the label names
pred_class_names = [kinetics_id_to_classname[int(i)] for i in pred_classes[0]]
print("Predicted labels: %s" % ", ".join(pred_class_names))
```
